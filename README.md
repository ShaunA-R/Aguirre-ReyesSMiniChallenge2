Thank you for giving me a peer review :)

The console project takes in two numbers from the users and adds them together, then giving the user the option to play again if they type in yes. When inputting values othe than numbers it causes the program to break. I liked the way the program was formatted making it easy to read. TryParse could fix the isue where the program breaks when user inputs string instead of int. Good job! :)
